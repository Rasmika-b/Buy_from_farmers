# Buy_from_farmers

An application which is developed according to the standards of the project development lifecycle which comes under software engineering.
The Project is described as follows:

1. Objective:

- ‘Buy from farmer’ is aimed at selling the farmer’s products directly to the customers without any dealers in between farmers and customers so that both the farmers and 
customers get benefitted. This system maintains a database of the farmer’s production left so the customers can pre-order the required items in advance if the items are available. The objective of the project is to help the farmers to sell their products at reasonable prices to the customers. This project helps farmers as a virtual dealer.

- The goal of the project is to reduce the time and cost incurred in access to the database and design a database feasible to provide appropriate results to the queries of all the stakeholders.

- The various aspects of the ‘Buy from farmer’ can be presented in views of the different people involved with it. The main people involved in the airline reservation are :

  1. Administrator’s view:
The administrator needs to know and control the information at all times and monitors the database to connect the farmers with customers.

  2. Customer’s view:
A customer needs to know the availability of products from each farmer and their respective prices so that they can place an order.

  3.  Farmers view:
A farmer should monitor his/her products and upload time to time in order to connect to the customers directly from our application.

2. Existing System

- There are many other software applications for buying fruits and vegetables from online from certain dealers. Like Amazon, Big Basket and many other applications all we have to do is put an order and get the products. 

- But, do these products guarantee freshness, or are they delivered directly from the farmers who invest a lot of time taking care of our diet and instead get less paid because of the dealers that come between the farmers and customers and make a huge payout in between these.

- All the existing systems do is get earnings from the online markets through various dealers. These dealers somehow manage to go to various shopping markets to get a better 
more incentive than they get from farmers.

- The loss from the existing system are both the farmers and the customers, as evencustomers are not satisfied with what products they get these days and the farmers aren’t 
happy as they are paid way lesser than what is expected.

3. Need for the New System:

- Yes, there is a big need for a new system in order to get the farmers what they actually want. The application ‘Buy from farmers’ we created is all about direct selling of goods from the farmers to the customers online with no involvement of any dealers or big markets.

- Here, the farmer acts as a virtual dealer and sells his/her products through online. The software application is designed in such a way to provide farmers a mean to earn what they have been doing for a longer time.

- The application is user friendly and has both the languages (Main and regional) for better interaction of both the farmers and the customers unlike the software’s present in the market.These kind of application in a market will always be in good faith and will continue for a growth in digital development and mankind.

10. Project Estimation:
    
- LOC Based Approach:
  
  Estimated LOC = 9010

  Burdened Labour Rate = 35,000 rupees.

  Average Productivity = 2000

    a) Cost per LOC = Burdened Labour Rate / Average Productivity = 35000 / 2000 = 17.5 rupees.
 
    b) Total Estimated Project Cost = Estimated Cost * Cost per LOC = 9010 * 17.5 = 1,57,675 rupees.
 
    c) Estimated Effort = Estimated Project Cost / Burdened Labour Rate = 157675 / 35000 = 4.5 ≅ 5 People per Month.
 
- COCOMO Model:

  BASIC (ORGANIC)
  
  KLOC = 9.2 (approx.)
  
  a) Effort, E = 2.4 * (9.2)^1.05 = 24.6710 PM
  
  b) Deployment Time, D = 2.5 * (24.6710)^0.38 = 8.4522 M
  
  c) Staff Size, SS = E / D = 24.6710 / 8.4522 = 2.91 ≅ 3 People
  
  d) Productivity, P = KLOC / E = 9.2 / 24.6710 = 0.3729

12. Conclusions & Future Enhancements:
    
- The software application is User Friendly and Bi-lingual.
- It has well-defined security system for verification during registrations.
- The Farmers and Customers getting direct benefit from this application as there is a proper selling and buying of goods with well monitored database.
- The software application can be promoted worldwide and the languages included in the software can be increased.

Happy Learning!!
